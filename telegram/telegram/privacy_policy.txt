# Privacy Policy

> You don't have to take our word on all of this. Telegram is an open source
project. Anyone can study our [API](https://core.telegram.org/api),
[Protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) and [Source Code](/apps#source-
code) and make an informed decision.

### __1\. Sharing data

We never share your data with anyone. To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes
of user data to third parties, including governments.

### __2\. Storing data

Telegram only stores the data it needs to function properly — for as long as
you want Telegram to function.

##### __Cloud Chats

Telegram is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents
from your _cloud chats_ on our servers, so that you can access your data from
any of your devices anytime and use our instant server search to quickly
access your messages from waaay back. All data is stored heavily encrypted and
the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other DCs in different
jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get
access to user data.

##### __Secret Chats

_Secret chats_ use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is
encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is **no way**
for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what
content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on
our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so
after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via
secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud
— you can only access those messages from the device they were sent _to_ or
_from_.

##### __Media in Secret Chats

When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded
each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key
and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret
chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. He can then download and decipher the
file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers,
but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except
for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and
we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge
this random data from our servers to save disk space.

##### __Contacts

Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers, so that it is easy for you
to switch from other messaging apps (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) and retain your
social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.

We store your contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts
signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications. We only
need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other
data about your contacts.

##### __Your e-mail address

When you enable 2-step-verification for your account, you can opt to set up a
password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password
recovery code, if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or “we miss you”
bullshit.

### __3\. Deleting data

##### __Accounts

If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the [deactivation
page](https://telegram.org/deactivate). Deleting your account permanently
removes all your **messages**, **groups** and **contacts**. This action must
be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.

##### __Messages

Everything you delete is deleted forever. Except for cats.  
We never delete your funny cat pictures, we love them too much.

When you delete a message, you delete it from your message history. This means
that a copy still stays on the server as part of your partner‘s message
history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it’s gone forever. Telegram's
goal is not to bring profit and we value the disk space on our servers
greatly.

In supergroups, deleted messages and original versions of edited messages are
stored for 48 hours in order to be shown in the admins log (added in Telegram
4.1.).

#### __Self-destructing messages

Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to [self-destruct](/faq#q-how-do-self-
destructing-messages-work). As soon as such a message is [read](/faq#q-what-
do-the-green-checks-mean) (2 checks appear), the countdown starts. When the
time is out, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to
delete the message (photo, video, etc.).

#### __Account self-destruction

We value our disk space greatly. If you stop using Telegram and do not login
for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages,
media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.
You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-
destruct in Settings.

### __4\. Payment information

The [Payment Platform for Bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments) is
available to users as of [Telegram 4.0](https://telegram.org/blog/payments).
Telegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different
payment providers around the world. It is the payment providers that handle
and store your credit card details. Neither Telegram nor the merchants on the
platform (bot developers) have access to this information.

#### __Credit card information

When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form
supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this
information goes directly to the payment provider‘s server. Your credit card
information never reaches Telegram’s servers. We do not access and do not
store your credit card information.

When you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment
provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a _token_ that can
you can reuse for future payments. It is not possible to reconstruct your
credit card info from the token.

#### __Shipping information

When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we
send it directly to the merchant bot developer. We can store your shipping
information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases. We will
delete this information immediately if you ask us to.

#### __Clearing payment information

You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time
by going to Telegram Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security and selecting ‘Clear
Payment &amp; Shipping Info’. If you choose to remove your payment
information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from
all providers and ask the providers to remove your credit card information
they store.

#### __Payment disputes

Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or
transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or
cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot
developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.
